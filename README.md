## Functional Requirements

The system must allow you to create lots and allow you to bid on them. At the current stage, bids are made by sending the name of the bidder in a POST request.

The auction works as follows:

- Lot creation
- Putting the lot in the "Bidding started" state
- Accepting bids on the lot
- Transferring the lot to the "Bidding is over" status
